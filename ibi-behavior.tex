\begin{abstract}
Fisheries are vulnerable to environmental shocks that impact stock
health and fisher income. Index insurance is a promising financial tool
to protect fishers from environmental risk. However, insurance will
change fisher's behavior through moral hazards. We provide the first
theoretical application of index insurance on fisher's behavior change
to predict if index insurance will incentivize overfishing or
conservation of the stock. Using traditional fishery models will always
bias index insurance to incentivize overfishing, which in turn reduces
fish stocks. However, using models with more flexible input risk effects
shows index insurance will have varying effects on fishery conservation.
The direction of change depends on the risk characteristics of the
inputs. We find that index insurance will raise (lower) individual
fisher effort when effort is risk increasing (decreasing). In turn,
higher (lower) fishing effort reduces (increases) conservation of fish
stocks. Overfished stocks will see conservation gains from reductions in
effort while undercapacity fisheries will see harvest gains from
increased production. The direction of harvest change becomes ambiguous
when accounting for interaction between multiple inputs. Simulating from
parameters estimated from four Norwegian fisheries shows index inusrance
could increase harvest as high as 15\% or decrease harvest by 6\%.
Before widespread adoption, careful consideration must be given to how
index insurance will incentivize or disincentivize overfishing.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Fisheries are vulnerable to stochastic weather shocks. Environmental
fluctuations directly impact fishers of all scales from large industrial
vessels to small scale subsistence fishers. Fishing is a vital economic
engine to coastal communities and is the primary source of protein for
millions of people (Sumaila \emph{et al.} 2012; Teh and Sumaila 2013;
FAO 2020). Supporting these communities requires protection from
enormous degrees of environmental risk.

Environmental variability in factors such as sea surface temperature or
wind speeds impact fishery biological and economic productivity. Marine
heatwaves increase animal thermal stress diminishing reproductive
ability (Barbeaux \emph{et al.} 2020), stunting growth (Pandori and
Sorte 2019), pushing species outside their usual habitats (Cavole
\emph{et al.} 2016), and may directly increase mortality (Smith \emph{et
al.} 2023). Expanding fish habitat ranges increase costs when moving
beyond the fishing grounds of established ports (Rogers \emph{et al.}
2019). The variability from marine heatwaves alone impacts 77\% of
species within economic exclusion zones and reduces maximum catch
potential by 6\% (Cheung \emph{et al.} 2021). Marine heatwaves are often
accompanied by harmful algal blooms and diseases leading to additional
fishery collapses (Oken \emph{et al.} 2021).

The devastation of marine heatwaves was made clear in October 2022 when
the Alaskan snow crab fishery was shut down after an assessment revealed
an 87\% decline in population from 2018 (Zacher \emph{et al.} 2022). New
evidence suggests that the marine heatwave increased caloric demands
while tightening the snow crab range leading to a mass starvation event
(Szuwalski \emph{et al.} 2023). The fishery provided \$132 million from
landings and \$174 million from processing in 2020, and the impacts from
the closure will reverberate throughout the community (Garber-Yonts and
Lee 2022). Recorded marine heatwaves have become more frequent (Holbrook
\emph{et al.} 2019) and climate change may continue to increase heatwave
frequency as climate distributions become more variable (Frölicher
\emph{et al.} 2018).

Weather can also impact fisher harvesting efficiency beyond influencing
the health of the underlying stock. Rolling seas and high wind speeds
make it more difficult to harvest (Alvarez \emph{et al.} 2006) in
addition to raising the danger to crew and vessel (Heck \emph{et al.}
2021). More intense storms threaten coastal infrastructure vital to
fishing communities (Sainsbury \emph{et al.} 2019). Fishers actively
avoid fishing in destructive weather at the expense of lost income
(Pfeiffer 2020). All together, environmental shocks increase total
income variability by changing harvest productivity or costs.

Individual choices by fishers and fishery management mitigate
environmental risk. However, there is a lack of financial tools
available to fishers to address income risk as a result of environmental
fluctuations (Sethi 2010; Kasperski and Holland 2013). New financial
tools need to be developed to alleviate financial and income risk for
coastal communities (Wabnitz and Blasiak 2019; Sumaila \emph{et al.}
2020).

Insurance may be an ideal financial tool for risk management in
fisheries as it is scalable, protects against environmental shocks, and
smooths income for fishers (Watson \emph{et al.} 2023). Currently,
insurance in fisheries is primarily used to protect assets such as
vessel hulls or fishing gear (FAO 2022). Insurance coverage could be
expanded to include income variability. Weather fluctuations impact
fisher income and their livelihoods. An insurance product covering
environmental risk could improve fisher welfare and promote community
resilience (Maltby \emph{et al.} 2023).

Policy makers have begun pushing for new fisheries insurance programs
modeled after agricultural crop insurance programs (Murkowski 2022).
Index insurance is one such product touted by practitioners as a prime
candidate for fisheries productivity insurance (Watson \emph{et al.}
2023). Index insurance gained traction in agriculture as an effective
alternative to traditional crop insurance in developing countries
because it had lower administrative cost, minimized moral hazards, and
does not require claim verification (Collier \emph{et al.} 2009; Carter
\emph{et al.} 2017). Whereas crop insurance requires an assessment of
loss to an individual farm, index insurance uses an independent measure
as the basis for issuing payouts to all policyholders. For example, a
pilot program through the Caribbean Oceans and Aqauculture
Sustainability Facility (COAST) uses index insurance to payout a set
amount to fishers when indices of wave height, wind speed, and storm
surge indicate a hurricane (Sainsbury \emph{et al.} 2019). Triggers are
the index values that initiate a payout. Contract design revolve around
establishing suitable triggers to cover environmental loss. Interest is
growing in expanding index insurance to cover other environmental shocks
to more fisheries.

One crucial area that remains unaddressed is the potential influence of
insurance on fishers behavior. Moral hazards are decisions by insured
agents that they would not otherwise take if they were uninsured (Wu
\emph{et al.} 2020). Owning insurance contracts will change fisher
harvesting decisions through moral hazards. In turn, conservation of
fish stocks will be impacted. Fisheries are highly dynamic systems
because of year to year variation in biological growth and reproduction
stemming from environmental variables. Overfishing impacts are
exacerbated through ecological dynamics as lower fish abundances carry
over to the next year. With 35.6\% of global fisheries overfished and
57.3\% at maximum sustainable yield (FAO 2022), ensuring new index
insurance programs do not incentivize perverse behavior towards more
overfishing is a necessary first assessment.

Currently, the assumption appears to be that index insurance would
completely avoid any moral hazards in fisheries (Watson \emph{et al.}
2023). Yet, there are two components to insurance moral hazard:
``chasing the trigger'' and ``risk reduction''. ``Chasing the trigger''
is the directed behavior of policyholders to increase the likelihood of
a payout. For example, a fisher actively choosing to fish less to
receive an indemnified harvest insurance payment. Index insurance
completely eliminates this moral hazard through the independent and
uninfluenced index (fishers cannot affect sea surface temperature).
``Risk reduction'' occurs through possessing an insurance contract that
protects policyholders from risk. Policyholders may reoptimize their
decisions once protected from risk. Index insurance remains susceptible
to this element of moral hazard that could manifest in maladaptive
behaviors. A simple example would be choosing to not wear a helmet while
riding a bike because you have health insurance. All preliminary
analyses of fisheries index insurance are missing rigorous assessment of
moral hazards. Moral hazards could enable behavior changes that lead to
conservation of fish stocks or spiral delicate systems towards
destruction.

Agricultural economists have grappled with insurance moral hazards for
decades. There are clear, demonstrable behavioral changes in farmers
because of insurance that impact environmental sustainability. Farmers
use more water (Deryugina and Konar 2017) and acreage with insurance
coverage (Goodwin \emph{et al.} 2004; Cai 2016; Claassen \emph{et al.}
2017). The direction of chemical input use varies with some studies
indicating increased fertilizer use (Horowitz and Lichtenberg 1993),
while others indicate less fertilizer use (Babcock and Hennessy 1996;
Smith and Goodwin 1996). Mishra \emph{et al.} (2005) were the first to
connect moral hazards to positive effects on the environment. Their
study found that reduced fertilizer use from insurance led to less
agricultural run-off pollution. Overall, insurance leads to
statistically significant changes in pollution levels, but are
proportionally rather small drivers of total agricultural pollution
(Claassen \emph{et al.} 2017).

Index insurance also leads to changes in farmers behavior. Index
insurance increased agricultural capital investments in Kenyan maize,
Burkina Faso cotton, and Mali cotton farmers (Elabed and Carter 2018;
Sibiko and Qaim 2020; Stoeffler \emph{et al.} 2022). Index insurance
also encouraged farmers in India to plant higher yield, but riskier
crops (Cole \emph{et al.} (2017)). In all instances, farmers took on
riskier positions with the protection offered by insurance. A clear
demonstration of the ``risk reduction'' element in index insurance moral
hazards.

Increased investments through insurance can also harm communities,
particularly in dynamic resources such as livestock grazing. Kenyan
index insurance for livestock discentivized preemptively selling animals
after negative shocks, leading to larger herds in aggregate (Janzen and
Carter 2018). Though no empirical work has been done on the long term
effects, two theoretical studies suggest insurance increases the
stocking levels of grazing animals in pastures. Higher stocking
densities diminish the pasture's ecological long-term health reducing
overall utility gains of insurance (Müller \emph{et al.} 2011; Bulte and
Haagsma 2021). Caution must be demonstrated when dealing with complex
bio-economic systems, otherwise maladaptive outcomes can lead to greater
harm (Müller \emph{et al.} 2017). The race to fish mentality that leads
to overexploitation is a defining characteristic of fisheries. If index
insurance always leads to increased input use in common pool resources,
then implementing index insurance in fisheries could lead to maladaptive
outcomes.

This paper explores how fishers could change their behavior if offered
viable index insurance contracts. We start in Section~\ref{sec-common}
with the canonical Gordon-Schaefer fisher production model to show that
one to one applications of index insurance in fisheries will always
decrease fish stocks leading to loss in abundance. If we adopt more
flexible production models from agriculture the affects of index
insurance becomes ambiguous, and may lead to healthier fish stocks. We
parameterize a model to demonstrate the potential impacts of index
insurance. However, the empirical setting uses multiple inputs.
Therefore, we extend the theoretical model to account for multiple
inputs in Section~\ref{sec-multi} to develop clearer insights with
possible input interactions. Numerical results in Section~\ref{sec-sim}
estimate potential harvest changes with an index insurance program.
Implications for the suitability of fishery index insurance are
discussed in Section~\ref{sec-disc}. Fishery index insurance ultimately
has ambiguous effects on conservation. Before widespread adoption,
careful consideration must be given to how insurance will incentivize or
disincentivize overfishing.

\section{Index insurance with standard fishery
models}\label{sec-common}}

The Gordon-Schaefer production model continues to be one of the most
used models in fishery modelling and management (Memarzadeh \emph{et
al.} 2019). Its simplicity captures a wide range of fishery dynamics and
is easily extendable to more complex models such as age-structured
(Tahvonen \emph{et al.} 2018). The model finds steady state bioeconomic
equilibrium that balances fish growth with fish harvest. Management
targets such as maximum sustainable and economic yield (MSY and MEY) are
easily derived from Gordon-Schaefer. Other popular surplus production
models such as the Fox and Pella-Tomlinson models, can reduce down to
the Gordon-Schaefer model through parameter choices. Given its ubiquity,
it would be prudent to start with the Gordon-Schaefer model to
understand how index insurance impacts fisheries.

Gordon-Schaefer captures biomass dynamics important to fisheries through
the steady state equilibrium biomass. Additionally, it allows us to
focus on a class of fisheries where behavior is unconstrained. Thus we
can isolate the effects of insurance more clearly.

The original model derives steady state biomass through a logistic
growth function and a linear technology function as a function of
effort. Substituting the steady state biomass as a function of effort
back into the linear technology function creates a production function
yielding steady state harvest. Environmental stochasticity can translate
to fluctuations in the steady state biomass.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-y}{}{
\begin{aligned}
y=qe\tilde{B}(e)\\
\tilde{B}(e)\sim N(\hat{B}(e),\sigma_b^2)
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-y}\end{equation}

Where \(q\) is a catchability coefficient, \(\tilde{B}\) is the random
steady state biomass with a mean at \(\hat{B}\) and a variance
\(\sigma_b^2\), and aggregated effort \(e\). We can break apart the
random variable into a mean effect (\(\hat{\beta}\)) and variance
component (\(\omega\)).

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-varb}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{B}(e)=\hat{B}(e)+\omega \\
\omega\sim N(0,\sigma_b^2)
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-varb}\end{equation}

Adding Equation~\ref{eq-varb} back into Equation~\ref{eq-y} leads to:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-y2}{}{
\begin{aligned}
y=qe(\hat{B}(e)+\omega)
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-y2}\end{equation}

This formulation is often referred to as process error (Merino \emph{et
al.} 2022). Randomness could originate from weather shocks impacting
equilibrium biomass in the current period or measurement error
surrounding a stock (Tilman \emph{et al.} 2018). Distributing the
production terms leads to \(y=qe\hat{B}(e)+\omega qe\), which we can
generalize to any mean production function \(f(e)\) and any risk
function \(h(e)\).

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-jp}{}{
\begin{aligned}
y=f(e)\hat{B}(e)+\omega h(e)
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-jp}\end{equation}

In Gordon Schaefer, \(f'(e)>0\) and \(h'(e)>0\) because catchability
\(q>0\). Steady state biomass is decreasing in effort as well,
\(\hat{B}'(e)<0\). Fishers derive utility from profits, so we add a
convex cost function to harvest and normalize price of harvest to 1.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-pi1}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\pi=f(e)\hat{B}(e)+\omega h(e)-c(e)
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-pi1}\end{equation}

To most seamlessly integrate index insurance, we can break situations
into a bad state of the world that occurs with probability \(p\) and a
good state of the world that happens with probability \((1-p)\). We can
use \(\omega\) to create an index to indemnify payouts because it
captures the randomness of fishers profits. In reality, the index would
be a weather variable known to impact biomass such as sea surface
temperature, and the trigger are critical thresholds that cause weather
to deviate from equilibrium biomass. Here, all stochasticity is captured
by \(\omega\). We can align the states of the world to a shock trigger
\(\bar\omega\) so that \(p=P(\omega<\bar\omega)\) and
\(1-p=P(\omega>\bar\omega)\).

Insurance then pays a constant amount \(\gamma\) in the bad state.
Actuarilly fair insurance allows the premium paid in both states to be
the probability of receiving a payout \(p\gamma\). Additionally, if we
set the trigger to \(\bar\omega=0\) to indicate any time weather
negatively impacts production, we can then separate out profit into good
and bad states as well with \(\omega_g>0\) and \(\omega_b<0\) entering
into Equation~\ref{eq-pi1}. Fishers are risk averse with a concave
utility function \(u'(\pi_i(e_i),\gamma)>0\) and
\(u''(\pi_i(e_i),\gamma)<0\). Putting it all together, fishers will
maximize expected utility across good and bad states by selecting effort
with a set insurance contract.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-max}{}{
F\equiv\max_{e}\mathbb{E}[u]=pu(\pi_b+(1-p)\gamma)+(1-p)u(\pi_g-p\gamma)
}\label{eq-max}\end{equation}

The first order condition that solves Equation~\ref{eq-max} is then:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-foc}{}{
\frac{\partial F}{\partial e}=pu'(\pi_b+(1-p)\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial e}+(1-p)u'(\pi_g-p\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial e}=0
}\label{eq-foc}\end{equation}

For notional ease, the inputs of the profit function are dropped, but as
shown in Equation~\ref{eq-pi1} profit in both states (\(\pi_b\)=bad,
\(\pi_g\)=good) remains a function of effort, equilibrium biomass, and
weather shocks.

To find the impact of insurance on optimal effort we can apply Cramer's
Rule to the first order conditions.

\[
\frac{\partial e^*}{\partial \gamma}=-\frac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial e \partial \gamma}}{\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial e^2}}
\]

By definition of a maximization problem,
\(\frac{\partial^2 F}{\partial e^2}\) is negative so we can focus solely
on the numerator to sign the impact of insurance on optimal individual
effort. Then we'll use the change in individual effort to understand the
implications on conservation.

\begin{proposition}[]\protect\hypertarget{prp-cp}{}\label{prp-cp}

Gordon-Schaefer production models will always lead to increases in
optimal effort with feasible index insurance contracts.

\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}

Differentiate equation Equation~\ref{eq-foc} with respect to insurance.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-egam}{}{
\frac{\partial F}{\partial e \partial \gamma}=(1-p)u''(\pi_g-p\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial e}(-p)+pu''(\pi_b+(1-p)\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial e}(1-p)
}\label{eq-egam}\end{equation}

Suppose insurance fully covers the loss between states, then utility in
the good state and bad state are equal to each other so that we can
factor out like terms in Equation~\ref{eq-egam}.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-simp}{}{
\frac{\partial F}{\partial e \partial \gamma}=(1-p)pu''(\cdot)[\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial e}-\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial e}]
}\label{eq-simp}\end{equation}

The first term outside the brackets is negative by the definition of
concave utility. Marginal profits across states share the same mean
productions and costs as effort decisions must be made before the
realization of the states. Subbing those terms in to
Equation~\ref{eq-simp} demonstrates how they cancel out allowing us to
sign the interior brackets.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-compi}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial e}-\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial e}&=\omega_b h_{e}'(e)+\cancel{f_{e}'(e)\hat{B}_{e}(e)}+\cancel{\frac{\partial \hat{B}}{\partial e}f(e_)}-\cancel{c_{e}'(e)} \\
&-\omega_g h_{e}'(e)-\cancel{f_{e}'(e)\hat{B}_{e}(e)}-\cancel{\frac{\partial \hat{B}}{\partial e}f(e)}+\cancel{c_{e}'(e)} \\
&=\omega_b h'(e)-\omega_g h'(e)
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-compi}\end{equation}

The marginal risk function is positive in Gordon-Schaefer so that
\(h'(e)>0\). With \(\omega_b<0\) and \(\omega_g>0\), then
Equation~\ref{eq-compi} is negative.

\[
\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial e}-\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial e}=\overbrace{\omega_bh'(e)-\omega_gh'(e)}^{-}
\]

Now can completely sign Equation~\ref{eq-simp} by subbing in the bracket
sign to show that effort will always increase.

\end{proof}

Proposition~\ref{prp-cp} solidifies the direction insurance impacts on
optimal effort decisions. In turn this will lead to destructive
conservation outcomes when using Gordon-Schaefer.

\begin{proposition}[]\protect\hypertarget{prp-synas}{}\label{prp-synas}

Index insurance always lowers steady state biomass in a Gordon-Schaefer
model.

\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}

Godron-Schaefer uses a logistic growth function so that mean equilibrium
biomass always decreasing in effort,
\(\frac{\partial\hat{B}(e)}{\partial e}<0\). By
Proposition~\ref{prp-cp}, effort will always increase with insurance.
Therefore, equilibrium biomass will always decrease with insurance.

\end{proof}

Contrary to initial hypotheses, index insurance will lead to
maladapative outcomes in fisheries with standard models.
Proposition~\ref{prp-cp} holds for more production models than just
Gordon-Schaefer. Any production function where \(h'(e)>0\) including
Cobb-Douglas, Pella-Tomlinson, and Fox models will lead to the same
results. However, these models were not designed to tackle risk and risk
aversion necessary for insurance in effective ways.

Agriculture also encountered a similar issue in the inception of crop
insurance programs back in the early 1980s. Risk averse farmers choose
inputs that deviated from expected values with Cobb-Douglas production
functions. Researchers posited alternative flexible production functions
to better capture the influence of risk on farmer decision making. Just
and Pope (1978) specified the general class of functions that could
adequately capture input risk effects that were both positive and
negative. Inputs that lead to higher production variance are risk
increasing with positive risk effects, and inputs that lowered the
variance of production are risk decreasing with negative risk effects.
Ramaswami (1993) and Mahul (2001) proved insurance would either increase
or decrease the input use contingent on the risk effect qualities of a
given input. Risk increasing inputs (\(h'(x)>0\)) always lead to
increases in input use with insurance, while risk decreasing inputs
(\(h'(x)<0\)) always lead to decreases in input use with insurance.
Within this framework, Gordon-Schaefer and all other fishery production
fisheries fall into the risk increasing category.

Fishers are highly sensitive to risk, especially income risk (Holland
2008; Sethi 2010). They mitigate risk through a variety of measures.
Fishers will choose consistent, known fishing grounds over risking
exploring unknown spots (Holland 2008). Fishers choose to fish less
after storms and hurricanes when financial risk is alleviated by
transitioning to catch share programs (Pfeiffer 2020; Pfeiffer \emph{et
al.} 2022). Perhaps they are making decisions surrounding risk beyond
that which is modeled by Gordon-Schaefer. If we allow for risk
decreasing inputs in fishery production, then the effects of insurance
can flip to improve steady state biomass. The proof of
Proposition~\ref{prp-cp} allows for risk decreasing inputs by switching
\(h'(e)<0\) in Equation~\ref{eq-compi}. The signs flip and insurance
will lower effort leading to an increase in biomass by
Proposition~\ref{prp-synas}. Therefore we can preserve the prior results
of agriculture in regards to the interaction of risk effects and
insurance while introducing the dynamics of fisheries.

Allowing for flexible risk effects in the standard fishery models shows
that the steady state impacts of insurance can either increase or
decrease biomass. This leads to varying welfare impacts depending on the
state of the fishery. In Figure~\ref{fig-synas}, the first initial
bieconomic equilibrium to the left demonstrates overexploitation with
biomass below maximum sustainable yield. A decrease an effort from index
insurance stimulates faster growth of the stock allowing for more
harvest in the future. Therefore fishers will be more protected from
shocks with insurance, benefit from more current harvest, and there will
be a a healthier stock of fish. Alternatively, if inputs are risk
increasing, then index insurance will shift production up, lowering
harvest and biomass of the fish pushing the fishery further into
overexploitation.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{ibi-behavior_files/figure-pdf/fig-synas-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-synas}Equilibrium harvest and biomass levels change
with index insurance depending on the risk effects of inputs. Deviations
from initial harvest equilibriums (solid line) have different impacts at
levels above and below maximum sustainable yield. Risk decreasing inputs
(long dashes) will always lead to higher equilibrium biomass. Risk
increasing inputs (short dashes) will always lead to lower equilibrium
biomass.}

\end{figure}

The second initial equilibrium to the right in Figure~\ref{fig-synas} is
underexploited with biomass above maximum sustainable yield. The impact
of index insurance on equilibrium biomass remains the same as when
overexploited by Proposition~\ref{prp-synas}, but the direction of
harvest changes. Now, insurance will lower harvest for risk decreasing
inputs and raise harvest for risk increasing inputs.

Figure~\ref{fig-synas} offers policymakers a powerful tool to assess the
viability of using index insurance to protect fisheries from
overharvesting and provide conservation benefits. Conservation of fish
stocks through insurance hinges on the risk effects of production
technology. If policymakers are solely interested in conservation, then
only knowing the direction of the fishery risk effects is necessary. In
that case, only fisheries with risk decreasing inputs should be targeted
for index insurance policies. Index insurance could also be used to
incentivize fishing in low capacity communities, much like how index
insurance is used in developing countries to stimulate agriculture
investment. Since most fisheries are overfished, it is unlikely that a
policymaker would target fisheries with risk increasing inputs with
insurance to expand capacity and place more pressure on the fish stock.

Risk effects remain an elusive concept in fisheries. It is unclear how
to preemptively identify fishery risk effects. Specific inputs such as
frost covers decrease the impact of weather on crops clearly. Other
inputs have had more ambiguous results. Fertilizer in some contexts is
risk increasing (Horowitz and Lichtenberg 1993) leading to crop burn,
but other times is risk decreasing (Babcock and Hennessy 1996).

To date, only one study has quantified risk effects in a fishery
setting. Asche \emph{et al.} (2020) used data from four Norwegian
fishing fleets to measure three input responses to risk. Each fishery
possessed unique mixes of both risk increasing and decreasing inputs.
For example, labor was found to be a risk decreasing input across all
four groups, but only statistically significant in pelagic and coastal
seiners. Capital was risk increasing for coastal seiners and trawlers,
but flipped to risk decreasing for purse seiners and trawlers. Fuel had
a lower, but statistically significant positive risk increasing measure
for three of the four groups.

However, total output variance fluctuated widely. Coastal seiners had
significant risk decreasing effects in labor, but also significant risk
increasing effects in fuel. Overall output variance was insignificantly
different than zero. So while individual inputs impacted risk, overall
impacts were unclear. Before applying the risk parameters found by Asche
\emph{et al.} (2020), it is beneficial to build out a multiple input
model to better understand how risk effects might behave in fisheries.
Single variable aggregate effort measures are useful in
surplus-production models, but do not reflect the complexity of fisher
decisions. Index insurance may raise or lower individual inputs
depending on their own unique risk effects, but the overall direction of
harvest decisions cannot be determined. Little research has been done on
multiple input insurance models. Ramaswami (1993) concluded that only
total production variance drives total harvest changes, but does not
elaborate on the individual response of inputs. The next section
explores how multiple inputs interact with each other and insurance to
provide a clearer picture of how index insurance will impact fisheries.

\hypertarget{sec-multi}{%
\section{Insurance with multiple inputs}\label{sec-multi}}

We can use the overarching framework from the previous section and
expand it by adding multiple inputs. To simplify matters, we will
normalize biomass to one as Asche \emph{et al.} (2020) did not
explicitly include biomass in their estimation model \footnote{They used
  year fixed effects to account for biomass}.

Some inputs have varying risk effects. Interaction between inputs risk
effects could change overall impacts from insurance to aggregate harvest
and biomass. Fishers can use a vector of inputs \(X\). Expected mean
production (\(f(X)\)) and variance of outputs (\(h(X)\)) remains the
same. We will use only two inputs, capital and labor, in our model to
simplify results without loss of generality. Total production thus
equals:

\[
\begin{aligned}
y(k,l)=f(k,l)+\omega h(k,l)\\
\text{where }\omega \sim N(0,\sigma^2)
\end{aligned}
\]

As before, random shocks that could be weather or biological shocks is
captured by \(\omega\). Mean production possess classic production
concavity so that \(f'(k,l)>0\) and \(f''(k,l)<0\). Flexible risk
effects imply that \(h'(k,l)\lesseqgtr0\) so that risk increasing
\(h'(k,l)>0\), risk decreasing (\(h'(k,l)<0\)), and no risk effects
\(h'(k,l)=0\). The original specification of Just and Pope make no
assumption on the form of the second derivative of the risk effect
function. To assist signing later on further justification is required.
The marginal impact of adding an input to production variance should
have diminishing effects, because it is impossible to completely
eliminate risk or experience infinite risks. Therefore, when
\(h'(k,l)>0 \rightarrow h''(k,l)<0\), and when
\(h'(k,l)<0 \rightarrow h''(k,l)>0\). The cross partial of risk effects
on production \(\frac{\partial h}{\partial k \partial l}\) must also be
flexible and depend on how inputs interact with each other. For example,
if adding an input does not contribute to the marginal variance of
another input then \(\frac{\partial h}{\partial k \partial l}=0\).
Inputs interactions could be complementary in that adding a risk
decreasing input further enhances the risk reducing properties of the
other inputs, e.g.~(\(\frac{\partial h}{\partial k \partial l}>0\)). In
other instances the inputs may interact counter actively in that adding
more of a risk increasing input might reduce the effect of a risk
decreasing input \(\frac{\partial h}{\partial k \partial l}<0\). In
principle, when inputs share direction of risk effects, their cross
partial ought to be complementary, and otherwise they will be counter
productive.

Costs are convex, \(c'(k,l)>0\) and \(c''(k,l)>0\), in each input.
Prices are constant and set at one so that production and costs together
form random profits.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-pi}{}{
\pi(k,l)=f(k,l)+\omega h(k,l)-c(k,l)
}\label{eq-pi}\end{equation}

We use the same insurance design from the previous section where
payouts, \(\gamma\), are triggered by \(\omega<0\), and we can partition
profit into good states and bad states. Fishers now maximize expected
utility by selecting both inputs, capital and labor.

\[
F\equiv\max_{k,l}\mathbb{E}[u]=pu(\pi_b(k,l)+(1-p)\gamma)+(1-p)u(\pi_g(k,l)-p\gamma)
\]

Taking the first order conditions yields:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-foc1}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial F}{\partial k}=(1-p)u'(\pi_g-p\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial k}+pu'(\pi_b+(1-p)\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial k} =0\\
\frac{\partial F}{\partial l}=(1-p)u'(\pi_g-p\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial l}+pu'(\pi_b+(1-p)\gamma)\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial l} =0
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-foc1}\end{equation}

Given the existence of the first order condition, we can use the
implicit function theorem (IFT) to look at the impact of an exogenous
variable change locally at the solution. In other words, using IFT will
clarify how a change to the insurance parameter \(\gamma\) will lead to
new allocations of capital and labor. We can differentiate
Equation~\ref{eq-foc1} with respect to \(\gamma\) by the chain rule.
This yields:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial k} & \frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial l} \\
\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial k} & \frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial l}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial k^*}{\partial \gamma} \\
\frac{\partial l^*}{\partial \gamma}
\end{pmatrix}
=-\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial \gamma} \\
\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial \gamma}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Inverting the Hessian matrix to the other side allows us to isolate the
effects on the optimal allocations.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-opt2}{}{
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial k^*}{\partial \gamma} \\
\frac{\partial l^*}{\partial \gamma}
\end{pmatrix}
=-
\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial k} & \frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial l} \\
\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial k} & \frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial l}
\end{pmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial \gamma} \\
\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial \gamma}
\end{pmatrix}
}\label{eq-opt2}\end{equation}

Crammer's rule allows us to solve this system of equations so long as
the determinant of the system is not equal to 0. Luckily, the
determinant is a 2x2 hessian of a concave maximization problem. By
definition it is strictly positive. Applying Crammer's rule to
Equation~\ref{eq-opt2} gives us:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial k^*}{\partial \gamma} \\
\frac{\partial l^*}{\partial \gamma}
\end{pmatrix}
=\frac{-1}{Det}
\begin{pmatrix}\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial l} & \frac{-\partial F}{\partial k \partial l} \\
\frac{-\partial F}{\partial l \partial k} & \frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial k}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial \gamma} \\
\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial \gamma}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Solving the systems yields:

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-ivtsol}{}{
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial k}{\partial \gamma}=\frac{-1}{Det}\left[\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial l}\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial \gamma}-\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial l}\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial \gamma}\right] \\
&\frac{\partial l}{\partial \gamma}=\frac{-1}{Det}\left[\frac{-\partial F}{\partial l \partial k}\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial \gamma}+\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial k}\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial \gamma}\right]
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-ivtsol}\end{equation}

Because the determinate will always be positive by the definition of the
second order condition, we can focus on the interior of the brackets. If
positive (negative), then insurance will lower (raise) use of that
input. To sign Equation~\ref{eq-ivtsol}, we need to determine the
partial derivatives. All six partials are included in the appendix. All
the partials help define the impact of insurance on multiple input use.

Fishers must be risk averse, and inputs must contribute to risk
management in some way. Otherwise, there will be no impact on insurance.

\begin{proposition}[]\protect\hypertarget{prp-rn}{}\label{prp-rn}

Risk neutral fishers will not change their input use with index
insurance

\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}

Risk neutrality implies that \(u'(k,l)=0\) and \(u''(k,l)=0\). Subbing
\(u''(k,l)=0\) into both Equation~\ref{eq-kgam} and
Equation~\ref{eq-lgam} forces them to both equal zero. Plugging zero for
\(\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial \gamma}\) and
\(\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial \gamma}\) into
Equation~\ref{eq-ivtsol} makes both elements also zero in the interior.
Thus risk neutral fishers would not change input allocation with the
addition of index insurance.

\end{proof}

To help prove the remaining propositions, the following corollary will
be valuable.

\begin{corollary}[]\protect\hypertarget{cor-mp}{}\label{cor-mp}

Marginal profit in the bad state of the world is greater (less) than
marginal profit in the good state for risk decreasing (increasing)
inputs. If inputs have zero risk effects, the marginal profits are
equivalent in both states.

\end{corollary}

The proof is included in the appendix.

\begin{proposition}[]\protect\hypertarget{prp-rezero}{}\label{prp-rezero}

Index insurance will not change the input allocations when all inputs
possess no risk effects.

\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}

The second part of Corollary~\ref{cor-mp} states that the marginal
profits across states are equal. If the marginal profits across states
are equal, then in Equation~\ref{eq-kgam} and Equation~\ref{eq-lgam} the
weight between positive and negative utilities is also equal and cancel
out leading to Equation~\ref{eq-kgam} and Equation~\ref{eq-lgam} both
equaling zero. Plugging zeros into Equation~\ref{eq-ivtsol} for the
insurance partials leads to an interior zero and no change in input use.

\end{proof}

Risk averse fishers will buy actuarially fair insurance. If the inputs
possess risk effects then they will lead to changes in the input.
Proposition~\ref{prp-samre} defines the change in multiple inputs
simultaneously with insurance.

\begin{proposition}[]\protect\hypertarget{prp-samre}{}\label{prp-samre}

With multiple inputs, index insurance will raise (lower) use of risk
increasing (decreasing) inputs in accordance to an inputs individual
risk effects when the following sufficient condition is true:

\(\frac{\partial F}{\partial k\partial l}>0\) when both inputs share the
same risk effects, and \(\frac{\partial F}{\partial k\partial l}<0\)
when inputs have opposite risk effects.

Otherwise, Index Insurance will have ambiguous effects on each input
allocation.

\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}

Corollary~\ref{cor-mp} allows us to sign Equation~\ref{eq-kgam} and
Equation~\ref{eq-lgam} for any risk effect on either input. Concave
utility by definition leads to \(u''<0\). For simplicity, we'll only
focus on Equation~\ref{eq-kgam}, but all applies equally to
Equation~\ref{eq-lgam}. Insurance payouts equalize profits between
different states. If insurance completely covers all loss, then we can
rewrite equation Equation~\ref{eq-kgam} as

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-kgamsol}{}{
\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial \gamma}=\overbrace{\overbrace{(1-p)pu''(\cdot)}^{-}\overbrace{[\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial k}-\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial k}]}^{-}}^{+}
}\label{eq-kgamsol}\end{equation}

Corollary~\ref{cor-mp} allows us to sign the interior brackets of
Equation~\ref{eq-kgamsol}. Risk increasing (decreasing) inputs make the
interior negative (positive). Thus, when an input is risk increasing
(decreasing), we can sign Equation~\ref{eq-kgam} and
Equation~\ref{eq-lgam} as positive (negative). Equation~\ref{eq-kk} and
Equation~\ref{eq-ll} will always be negative due to concave utility.

Suppose both inputs are risk increasing so Equation~\ref{eq-kgam} and
Equation~\ref{eq-lgam} are positive. The only way for
Equation~\ref{eq-ivtsol} to be unambiguously positive is for
Equation~\ref{eq-crossl} and Equation~\ref{eq-crossk} to be positive.

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial k}{\partial \gamma}=\overbrace{\frac{-1}{Det}}^{-}\left[\overbrace{\overbrace{\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial l}}^{-}\overbrace{\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial \gamma}}^{+}\overbrace{-\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial l}}^{-}\overbrace{\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial \gamma}}^{+}}^{-}\right] >0\\
&\frac{\partial l}{\partial \gamma}=\overbrace{\frac{-1}{Det}}^{-}\left[\overbrace{\overbrace{\frac{-\partial F}{\partial l \partial k}}^{-}\overbrace{\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial \gamma}}^{+}+\overbrace{\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial k}}^{-}\overbrace{\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial \gamma}}^{+}}^{-}\right]>0
\end{aligned}
\]

Both risk increasing inputs will be raised with index insurance. The
results hold for risk decreasing inputs as the overall signs flip. Risk
decreasing inputs will be lowered with index insurance.

Now suppose inputs have mixed risk effects. For simplicity, capital will
be risk increasing and labor will be risk decreasing. The results will
hold for the opposite case. By Corollary~\ref{cor-mp},
Equation~\ref{eq-kgam} is positive, while Equation~\ref{eq-lgam} is
negative. Equation~\ref{eq-ivtsol} will be unambiguously positive if
Equation~\ref{eq-crossl} and Equation~\ref{eq-crossk} are negative.

\[
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial k}{\partial \gamma}=\overbrace{\frac{-1}{Det}}^{-}\left[\overbrace{\overbrace{\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial l}}^{-}\overbrace{\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial \gamma}}^{+}\overbrace{-\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial l}}^{+}\overbrace{\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial \gamma}}^{-}}^{-}\right] >0\\
&\frac{\partial l}{\partial \gamma}=\overbrace{\frac{-1}{Det}}^{-}\left[\overbrace{\overbrace{\frac{-\partial F}{\partial l \partial k}}^{+}\overbrace{\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial \gamma}}^{+}+\overbrace{\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial k}}^{-}\overbrace{\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial \gamma}}^{-}}^{+}\right]<0
\end{aligned}
\]

The risk increasing input will be raised with index insurance, while the
risk decreasing input will be lowered.

\end{proof}

Proposition~\ref{prp-samre} shows that index insurance can have clear
impacts even in complex settings with multiple inputs provided the
sufficient condition holds. However, it is not clear ex-ante what the
sign of the cross partial inputs of the first order condition should be.
Equation~\ref{eq-crossl} and Equation~\ref{eq-crossk} themselves could
be ambiguous. Rearranging Equation~\ref{eq-crossl} and
Equation~\ref{eq-crossk} shows that the relative weight between the
marginal profits of each input \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial k}\) and the
risk effects cross partial \(\frac{\partial h}{\partial k \partial l}\)
will determine the overall sign of the first order cross partials.
Essentially, fishers change their inputs depending on whether a given
input makes the other input more productive than the risk it adds.
Dividing Equation~\ref{eq-crossk} by \(-\frac{u'}{u'}\) allows us to
rearrange terms to show the tension between mean production and risk
effects.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-crosssolve}{}{
\begin{aligned}
-\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial l}&=(1-p)u'\frac{-u''}{u'}\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial k}\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial l}-(1-p)u'\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial k\partial l}\frac{u'}{u'}\\
&+ pu'\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial k}\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial l}\frac{-u''}{u'}-pu'\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial k \partial l}\frac{u'}{u'}\\
&=(1-p)u'[\frac{-u''}{u'}]\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial k}\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial l}+pu'[\frac{-u''}{u'}]\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial k}\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial l}\\
&-(1-p)u'\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial k\partial l}-pu'\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial k \partial l}
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-crosssolve}\end{equation}

The concavity of profit with positive risk aversion \(\frac{-u''}{u'}\)
lead line 3 in Equation~\ref{eq-crosssolve} to be positive. The cross
partials in line 4 paint a more complicated picture. Whether inputs
enhance or reduce the risk effect qualities of each other influences the
weight of line 4. When inputs share risk effects, they ought to increase
the risk effects of each other so that
\(\frac{\partial h}{\partial k \partial l}>0\). Therefore line 4 in
Equation~\ref{eq-crosssolve} becomes more negative as all terms are
positive. It is relatively more likely that Equation~\ref{eq-crosssolve}
is negative when risk effects are shared.

When risk effects are mixed, with one input increasing and one input
decreasing, the risk effects counteract each other
\(\frac{\partial h}{\partial k \partial l}<0\). Line 4 in
Equation~\ref{eq-crosssolve} becomes relatively less negative. If the
difference between the risk effects cross partial
\(\frac{\partial h}{\partial k \partial l}\) outweigh the mean
production cross partial \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial k \partial l}\)
then line 4 becomes unambiguously becomes positive. Then
\(-\frac{\partial F}{\partial k \partial l}>0\) and
\(-\frac{\partial F}{\partial l \partial k}>0\). The relative changes
with complimentary or counteractive risk effects matches the signs
needed for the condition in Proposition~\ref{prp-samre} to hold.

Despite the seemingly rigid conditions, Proposition~\ref{prp-samre} is
quite powerful. It states that the direction all inputs should change is
based solely on the characteristics of their own risk effects. Other
inputs may influence the magnitude of change, but the direction is
unequivocal. It remains unclear how much overall harvest will change.
Simulations show the total impact on harvest can vary substantially, and
that the conditions to ensure unambiguous change can be met. Though when
applied with real world estimates of risk effects, the conditions may
not hold and the effects of index insurance may not follow simple rules.

\hypertarget{sec-sim}{%
\section{Numerical Simulations}\label{sec-sim}}

We use a simple numerical simulation to test the necessary conditions in
Proposition~\ref{prp-samre} and to determine the magnitude of change in
input use for Norwegian fisheries using the parameters found in Asche
\emph{et al.} (2020). First, we present the simulations from the two
input case to gain additional insight into how index insurance changes
multiple inputs. Fisher earn profit through harvest with a Just and Pope
production function with mean biomass normalized to one, and convex cost
function.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-sim}{}{
\pi(k,l)=\hat{B}k^{\alpha_k}l^{\alpha_l}+\omega k^{\beta_k}l^{\beta_l}-c_kk^2-c_ll^2
}\label{eq-sim}\end{equation}

Random shocks (\(\omega\)) are distributed normally with a mean of zero
and a standard deviation of \(\sigma_w\). Capital (\(k\)) and labor
(\(l\)) have both mean production elasticities (\(\alpha_k\) and
\(\alpha_l\)) and flexible risk elasticities (\(\beta_k\) and
\(\beta_l\)). Fishers choose both capital and labor to maximize expected
utility. We use a constant absolute risk aversion utility function.

Multiple index insurance policies are tested through changes in coverage
and trigger levels. One scenario set constant payout amounts at 50\% of
pre-insurance profit and the other allows fishers to choose payouts.
Trigger levels are set to engage at any below average weather, shocks of
more than 75\% loss, and catastrophic shocks that reduce biomass below
90\%. All premiums are actuarilly fair. We vary fisher production
parameters and risk aversion to create a comprehensive dataset of
possible combinations. Risk effects vary between -0.7 and 0.7 with
iterative increases of 0.1 ignoring situations of 0 risk effects.
Fishers can posses low, medium, and high mean elasticity values
\(\alpha\in\{0.25,0.5,0.75\}\). Coefficient of constant absolute risk
aversion ranges from 1 to 3. Within each scenario, a Monte Carlo
simulation creates 1000 weather random weather shocks with three
variants of standard deviation \(\sigma_w\in\{0.33,0.66,1\}\).

\hypertarget{numerical-simulation-results}{%
\subsection{Numerical simulation
results}\label{numerical-simulation-results}}

Increasing insurance incentivizes fishers to use more risk decreasing
inputs and less risk increasing inputs (Figure~\ref{fig-ins}). The
conditions of Proposition~\ref{prp-samre} can be satisfied with CARA
utility, a Just-Pope Production function, and normal values of mean and
risk elasticities. Index insurance also increases utility shown by the
green lines in Figure~\ref{fig-ins}, but there exists an optimal amount
of insurance coverage for fishers. The optimal values of insurance are
generally lower when fishers use risk decreasing inputs. The inputs and
insurance act as substitutes for each other both lowering the variance
of income fishers experience.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{ibi-behavior_files/figure-pdf/fig-ins-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-ins}Fisher utility (green line) is concave in
insurance payouts. Inputs change in accordance to their individual risk
effects. The secondary y-axis shows input allocations for capital (blue
line) and labor (red line). Panel A has both inputs with positive risk
effects (\(\beta=0.5\)). Panel B has both inputs with negative risk
effects (\(\beta=-0.5\)). Panel C shows the effects when capital is a
risk decreasing input (\(\beta=- 0.5\)) while labor is risk increasing
(\(\beta=0.5\)). Panel D flips the risk effects of capital and labor.}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-ins} shows that conditions of
Proposition~\ref{prp-samre} can be satisfied, but it does not show the
conservation outcomes of index insurance. Fishers use the new allocation
of inputs to change their overall harvest and thus impact on the biomass
of fish stocks. Harvest changes are influenced by the relative
combination of risk effects, mean production elastiticies, and the
amount of insurance. Fishers reduce harvest more aggressively with risk
decreasing inputs when offered a set contract of 50\% coverage of
pre-insurance profits (Panel A) relative to their optimal choice (Panel
B) (Figure~\ref{fig-multi-h-even}). Allowing fishers to choose their
insurance coverage leads them to increase harvest more with risk
increasing inputs. This phenomenon relates back to Figure~\ref{fig-ins}.
A 50\% coverage is an overinvestment in insurance for risk decreasing
inputs and an underinvestment for risk increasing inputs.

Mixed risk effects reduce the overall impact on harvest. The more
flexible risk parameter dominates the less flexible one in terms of
which input reduces overall harvest shown in the top left and bottom
right quadrants of both panels in Figure~\ref{fig-multi-h-even}.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{ibi-behavior_files/figure-pdf/fig-multi-h-even-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-multi-h-even}Percent Change in fishing harvest when
fishers use index insurance with low mean elasticity values
(\(\alpha_{k,l}=0.25\)). In Panel A, Insurance payouts are a set
variable. In Panel B, fishers choose insurance payouts. Red colors show
overall decreases in harvest while blue colors show overall increases in
harvest.}

\end{figure}

Increasing the mean elasticities exacerbates the discrepancies between
allowing fishers to choose insurance payouts versus receiving a set
amount. When the productivity of harvest (\(\alpha\)) is higher, the
tradeoff between reducing variance and catch changes. Though insurance
protects against risk, lowering the use of risk reducing inputs looses
more mean catch with higher production elasticities. Fishers reduce
aggregate harvest less with risk reducing inputs when mean elasticities
are high. The opposite is true for risk increasing inputs. Insurance
protects against the variance of adding more inputs and fishers receive
a greater mean catch.

\subsection{Application to Real World
Fisheries}\label{application-to-real-world-fisheries}}

Asche et al., (2020) aggregated by vessel type and not species, so there
is no reasonable estimate for biomass. They accounted for biomass using
fixed effects in their regression, but without additional information,
our simulations normalize biomass to 1 and only focus on the relative
change in inputs and aggregate harvest. The simulation model extends the
two input case to include fuel (\(f\)).

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-sim3}{}{
\pi(k,l)=k^{\alpha_k}l^{\alpha_l}f^{\alpha_f}+\omega k^{\beta_k}l^{\beta_l}k^{\beta_f}-c_kk^2-c_ll^2-c_ff^2
}\label{eq-sim3}\end{equation}

Table~\ref{tbl-asche} shows the production and risk elasticities of the
four vessel types used in the simulation. While not all elasticities
were found to be statistically different from zero, we used their raw
values because dropping only those variables that are significant in
both matching parameters would have kept only a few valid combinations.
All non-significant elasticities led to small changes as expected, but
their interactions with other inputs could partially drive some of the
observed outcomes.

Index insurance in Norwegian fisheries would have lead to changes in
input use and overall harvest. Table~\ref{tbl-nor} shows that index
insurance would have lead to a maximum change of 15\% in total harvest
for the coastal groundfish fishery. This was primarily driven by large
increases in capital (20.36\%) and fuel (8.89\%). All inputs had
relatively similar mean production elasticities, but capital was
strongly risk increasing with the highest positive risk elasticity.
Labor was a risk decreasing input, but also rose with insurance. This is
an example where the conditions of Proposition~\ref{prp-samre} do not
hold. The large discrepancy in production risk elastiticites is probably
a reason for this in addition to the interactions terms at play by
adding a third input. The chosen insurance payout was also much higher
than the other vessel types. This reflects the observation from
Figure~\ref{fig-ins} that that fishers choose higher levels of insurance
coverage as a means to substitute the additional risk they are taking
with expanded production.

Purse seiners saw the largest reduction in overall harvest. Capital for
purse seiners is the most productive input out of all fisheries and
inputs. Because it is risk reducing, it dominates the slightly risk
increasing fuel input to lead the entire fishery to reduce harvest by
6.3\%. this shows another violation of Proposition~\ref{prp-samre}. In
the opposite direction this time. Labor allocations did not change. No
labor was allocated in either optimal choice, because the production
elasticity was negative. Insurance payouts were also higher than the
other fisheries that saw reductions. The high productivity of capital
and fuel were most likely driving this result because small reductions
in these productive inputs needed larger compensations.

Coastal seiners are perhaps the most intriguing outcome, because all
parameters were significant and shows the conditions for
Proposition~\ref{prp-samre} can hold in the real world with multiple
inputs. All input use changes followed their respective risk effects.
Capital (0.44\%) and fuel (0.11\%) both increased, while labor (-1.01\%)
decreased. In aggregate, there was a small reduction in harvest (0.3\%).
While insurance lead to a change, it was rather small and would not have
a large impact on the fishery. The counteractive effects of the risk
effects may negate some of the desire to change production as insurance
incentivizes both increases and decreases in harvest.

Inputs in the groundfish trawler industry were all risk reducing.
Unsurprisingly, each input saw a reduction in use when index insurance
was offered. Capital was extremely risk reducing and saw a 4.14\%
reduction in use, but was a relatively less productive input so overall
harvest changed by only 1.4\%. Insurance payouts were selected to be low
as seen in the two input simulations with risk decreasing inputs.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec-disc}}

Index insurance will have behavioral impacts on fisheries harvest, which
in turn will lead to conservation implications. Policy tools leveraging
behavioral changes have been used to promote environmental conservation
of water, energy, and fisheries (Campbell \emph{et al.} 2004; Reddy
\emph{et al.} 2017; McDonald \emph{et al.} 2020). Index insurance has
the potential to be a tool to help conserve fish population in addition
to its income smoothing, but it depends on the underlying risk effects
of inputs. As shown in this paper, harvest pressures could reduce by 6\%
in Norwegian purse seiners. Norway has well managed fisheries. This
would place these fisheries to the right or near MSY in
Figure~\ref{fig-synas} so that a reduction in 6\% harvest also
corresponds to some level of improved fish stocks. However, the
ambiguous and sensitive nature of index insurance as a behavioral policy
tool also opens the possibility of maladaptive outcomes that further
unsustainable practices. Norwegian coastal groundfish trawlers are
incentivized to increase their harvest by 15.4\% with index insurance.
Behavioral policies can backfire through unintended consequences
especially in complex bio-economic settings (Abbott and Haynie 2012).
Therefore, it is imperative to have some preemptive understanding of
potential shortfalls of new policies.

The fishery conservation success or failure of index insurance hinges on
input risk effects. Risk effects need to be reconciled in fisheries in
order to articulate more accurate behavior changes of fishery index
insurance. Crop covers and pesticide provide clear examples of risk
decreasing inputs in agriculture, but what do risk decreasing inputs
look like in fisheries? Asche \emph{et al.} (2020) provide empirical
evidence of the existence of risk decreasing inputs, but do not
elaborate on why or how labor and capital directly decrease risk. Labor
is perhaps the more intuitive risk decreasing input. Technical expertise
of crew and captains can hedge against luck when fishing (Alvarez
\emph{et al.} 2006). Better trained crew can deploy gear in a safe and
timely manner, increasing the likelihood of effective sets.

Capital is a more complex input, because it can be both risk increasing
and decreasing. Capital investments in fisheries typically refer to
vessel tonnage, engine power, and gear technology The spatiotemporal
dimension of fishing decisions may explain how capital can potentially
possess both risk effects. Fishers have to make decisions on where,
when, and how long to fish that differ from the set grids of agriculture
(Reimer \emph{et al.} 2017). Capital offers protection from risk by
allowing fishers to explore more fishing grounds, use more secure gear,
and fish in more adverse weather conditions. When common pool resources
incentivize the race to fish, having larger vessels may be a risk
reducing input as the sooner a fisher can catch they assure their income
at the expense of other fishers. Adding risk aversion to standard models
of common pool fisheries suggests fishers should lower their capital use
compared to risk neutral allocations (Mesterton-Gibbons 1993; Tilman
\emph{et al.} 2018). Yet, overcapitalization and overfishing are more
often observed in the real world. Either fishers are never risk averse
or the risk effects of capital are not as simple as the standard model
suggests. When capital is allowed to be a risk decreasing, optimal
allocations are much higher than risk neutral equilibrium suggesting
fishers are making rational, risk averse decisions.

The transfer between inputs and insurance reflects the substitution
between self-insurance and formal insurance (Quaas and Baumgärtner
2008). If index insurance is designed to reduce fishing capacity,
efforts must be made to ensure that it does not take away from the self
resiliency of fishers. Labor appears to be consistently risk reducing
and acts as a form of self insurance. If index insurance incentivizes
captains to hire less crew, the stock of fish may be preserved, but less
employment may reverberate throughout the community. Fishing is often a
primary employment opportunity in coastal communities. Lowering
employment options may lead to increased poverty or concentrated wealth.
The resiliency of the community would be compromised rather than
enhanced. The same idea applies to capital. If fishers are over
investing in capital to hedge against some form of risk, policymakers
need to be sure the insurance is replacing maladaptive self insurance
behavior.

The primary form of self insurance in fisheries is management. To this
point our analysis explicitly modeled scenarios without the existence of
management. Most fisheries are managed in some form. The interaction
between management and insurance may be complementary or substitutes.
For example, well managed fisheries that have responsive harvest control
rules may not need insurance. The management system is already providing
the necessary risk protection. Insurance demand and uptake may be low in
these fisheries. Insurance may also complement management to provide the
financial relief that management cannot offer. Managers often focus on
the biological health of the fishery that can run at odds with fishers'
desires to enhance their income. Insurance can act as the financial
relief and allow managers to pursue more active strategies to protect
fish stocks without political resistance from lowered quotas. The
interaction between insurance and management requires further
investigation especially with the the numerous management strategies
that exist in fisheries.

Design and access of insurance must also consider equity. The current US
federal disaster relief program is inequitable with bias towards large
industrial vessels (Jardine \emph{et al.} 2020). Replacing the program
with an equally inequitable program would be foolhardy. Current US farm
subsidies, including insurance premiums, are heavily skewed towards
large agribusinesses (White and Hoppe 2012). Dimensions of access,
procedural, representation, and distribution must all be built into the
design of new fishery index insurance programs (Fisher \emph{et al.}
2019). For example, small scale fishers may have income constraints that
prevent them from buying the initial contract. Micro-finance options
connected to insurance have been used in agriculture to alleviate this
burden with some success (Dougherty \emph{et al.} 2021). Additionally,
we must ensure that is not only the vessel owners who reap the benefits
of insurance. Deckhands and crew are laid off during closures. If index
insurance payouts are going through the entire fishery, the most
vulnerable to closures must be protected as well. Contract stipulations
could mandate that only cost expenses are covered by payouts thereby
including lost wages to the crew. Agriculture contracts often are
designed to directly cover expenses.

Our model only directly models behavior change through moral hazards.
Index insurance could be designed to incentivize other forms of
sustainable behavior change. We define three pathways insurance can
change behavior: Moral hazards, Quid Pro Quo, and Collective Action.
Moral hazards were proven in this paper to have ambiguous impacts
controlled by the risk characteristics of fishery inputs.

Quid Pro Quo is the idea that insurance contracts could be designed with
conservation measures built in. Fishers would be required to adopt
sustainable practices in order to qualify for insurance. Quid Pro Quo is
already used in agricultural insurance in the form of Good Farm
Practices. Farmers must submit management plans to US Risk Management
Agency that clearly outline their conservation practices in order to
qualify for insurance. Working closely with management agencies,
insurance companies could design contracts that require fishers to
follow fishery specific management practices. For example, fishers may
be incentivized to use more sustainable gear types, have an observer
onboard, or reduce bycatch. Manager input is needed to tailor fishery
best practices to insurance contracts. Further research would need to
uncover the full impact of Quid Pro Quo, but an initial hypothesis would
be the fishers will be willing to adopt sustainable practices so long as
the marginal gain in utility from the insurance is greater or equal to
the necessary sustainable changes. Otherwise fishers will not want to
buy the contracts and the insurance has no binding stipulations to
change the fishery.

Collective action ties insurance premiums to biological outcomes to
leverage the political economy of the fishery. Insures could reduce
premiums in fisheries that have robust management practices such as
adaptive harvest control rules, stock assessments, or marine protected
areas in the vicinity. Fishers could either pressure regulators to adopt
these actions or form industry groups to undertake the required actions.
Insurers would agree to this if triggers are connected to biological
health so that negative shocks are less frequent and thus payouts occur
less. Fishers gain from the insurance premium and the increases
sustainability of harvest with rigorous management in place.

Ultimately, if index insurance is to be used in fisheries, it must be
designed with clear objectives and intentions. Index insurance can meet
objectives of income stability and risk reduction. There has been an
implicit assumption by practitioners that index insurance will always
lead to improved sustainability. Without considering the behavior change
of fishers when adopting insurance, the outcomes may not be as expected.
Index insurance will correct risk reducing overcapacity in specific
fisheries providing boosts to the long term sustainability and
conservation of fisheries.

Proof of Corollary~\ref{cor-mp}.

\textbf{Corollary 3.1} \emph{Marginal profit in the bad state of the
world is greater (less) than marginal profit in the good state for risk
decreasing (increasing) inputs. If inputs have zero risk effects, the
marginal profits are equivalent in both states.}

By the first order conditions, there exist optimal values \(k^*\) and
\(l^*\) that must be chosen before the realization of the states of the
world. Therefore \(h(k^*,l^*)\), \(f(k^*,l^*)\), and \(c(k^*,l^*)\) are
equal across states.

Marginal utility in both states of the world is controlled by risk
effects and the sign of the random variable \(\omega\). Risk increasing
inputs have \(h'(k,l)>0\) by definition. For either input \(k,l\)
denoted by \(x\) this holds

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-comppi1}{}{
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial x}&=\omega_b h_{x}'(k,l)+\cancel{f_{x}'(k,l)}-\cancel{c_{x}'(k,l)} \\
&-\omega_g h_{x}'(k,l)-\cancel{f_{x}'(k,l)}+\cancel{c_{x}'(k,l)} \\
&=\omega_b h_{x}'(k,l)-\omega_g h_{x}'(k,l)
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-comppi1}\end{equation}

If an input is risk decreasing then \(h_x'(k,l)<0\) with \(\omega_b<0\)
and \(\omega_g>0\). Then Equation~\ref{eq-comppi1} is positive and
marginal profit in the bad state is greater than the marginal profit in
the good state. Adding more of a risk reducing input reduces the
negative impact in the bad state relative to the good state.

\[
\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial x}=\overbrace{\omega_bh_x'(k,l)-\omega_gh_x'(k,l)}^{+}
\]

Repeating the same thing for risk increasing inputs \(h_x'(k,l)>0\)
shows that marginal profit in the bad state is less than marginal profit
in the good state.

\[
\frac{\partial \pi_b}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial \pi_g}{\partial x}=\overbrace{\omega_bh_x'(k,l)-\omega_gh_x'(k,l)}^{-}
\]

If inputs have no risk effects then \(h'(k,l)=0\). Subbing into
Equation~\ref{eq-comppi1} shows there is no difference in marginal
profits with no risk effects.
